The boats arrive at a port with times between arrival exponentials with an average of 1.25 days. 
The port has a pier with two berths and two cranes to download the boats. The ships that arrive 
when both berths are busy join a FIFO queue. The time for a crane to unload a ship is distribute 
as a uniform between 0.5 and 1.5 days. If only one boat is at the berth, both Cranes unload the 
boat and the time is reduced by half. When two boats are in the Berth, each crane will take care 
of a different boat. If both cranes are downloading a ship and a second ship arrives at the berth 
one of the cranes begins to serve to this ship and the time remaining to the first ship is doubled. 
Run the simulation for 90 days. You want to calculate the average wait time of a ship to be served 
and the time maximum as well as the minimum, average and maximum discharge time.
